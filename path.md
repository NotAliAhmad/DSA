If you are familiar with Go (Golang) and want to delve into data structures and algorithms (DSA), here are some fundamental topics that you can focus on:
Arrays and Slices: Understand how arrays and slices work in Go, including basic operations and common use cases.

- Linked Lists: Learn about singly and doubly linked lists. Implement basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- Stacks and Queues: Understand the concepts of stacks and queues. Implement them using slices or linked lists.

- Trees: Study binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and balanced trees. Learn about tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

- Graphs: Explore graph representations and common algorithms, such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).

- Hashing: Understand hash tables and hash functions. Learn about collision resolution techniques.

- Sorting and Searching: Study classic sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) and searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).

- Dynamic Programming: Learn dynamic programming principles and solve problems using memoization and bottom-up approaches.

- Greedy Algorithms: Understand greedy algorithms and how they make locally optimal choices to achieve a global optimum.

- Bit Manipulation: Explore bitwise operations and their applications in algorithms, especially in scenarios where memory efficiency is crucial.

- Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union): Learn about the Union-Find data structure and its applications in solving problems related to dynamic connectivity.

- Trie: Study the trie data structure, which is particularly useful in scenarios involving strings and dictionaries.

- Advanced Data Structures: Explore more advanced data structures like segment trees, Fenwick trees (Binary Indexed Trees), and AVL trees.

- Algorithmic Paradigms: Familiarize yourself with various algorithmic paradigms, including divide and conquer, recursion, and backtracking.

- Graph Algorithms: Dive deeper into graph algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths and Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

To practice DSA with Go, you can use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces. Implementing algorithms and solving problems will solidify your understanding of DSA concepts in the context of Go programming. Additionally, consider referring to online resources, tutorials, and books focused on data structures and algorithms in the context of Go.

- Graphs, directred graph, undirectred graph; look into different graph search algos such as graph search, depth first search, breadth first search, dijkstra's algo. also look into topological sort and how to find a loop in a graph

- Stacks(LIFO)/ Queues(FIFO); implemented using arrays or linked lists;
look into this as its not always clear on when to use them

- Hash table/ hash map; use this when u want some value as fast as possible

- Binary tree; used in database indexing, sorting algos and decision trees
    - Binary trees are perfect for recursion
    Learn tree traversal such as per-order, post-order, in-order, level order

- Heap, max heap, min heap; uses algo called heapify, heap sort, dijkstra's algorithm, median of stream

- Breadth First Search and Depth First Search; DFS is implemented using a stack while a BFS is implemented using a queue. Also look at  dijkstra's algo and topological sort

- Dynamic Programming 

- Backtracking: Implemented using recursion

- Sliding window: 

- top k elements: works well in conjunction with heap
